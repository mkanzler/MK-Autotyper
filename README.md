# AutoTyper - Data Entry Tool 

Some applications don't allow copy 'n' paste. This application is simulating keystrokes so that it does not look like past.
So basically it saves a lot of time! Who likes to type text if past for some reason is not working?
I couln't find any light way application for Windows which does the same. So I wrote this one.
